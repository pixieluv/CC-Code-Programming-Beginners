# Principles of Programming (CSE 110) - Coursework Repository

This repository contains my personal coursework and projects from the ** "Programming for Beginners" (CSE 110) ** curriculum.

As a senior-level strategic operator and "systems thinker," my career has been focused on building high-level frameworks for business operations, FinOps, and product GTM. I am now applying that same relentless curiosity to build a deeper, foundational understanding of software development from the ground up.

This repository is part of my "back to basics" journey to explore the underlying logic and principles of programming.

## Course Details

This work is based on the "Programming for Beginners" full course available on freeCodeCamp.org, which uses the curriculum from GoStudyHall's "Principles of Programming (CSE 110)."
